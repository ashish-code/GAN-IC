# GAN-IC
Image composition using GAN in conjunction with Homography estimation using HomographyNet and application of affine warp using Spatial Transformer Networks. Subsequently, appearance attributes of spatial transformed images will be modified using image intrinsic attribute estimation and applied using associated GAN/VAE.
